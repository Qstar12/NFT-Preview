## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./images/mysolution.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Im proud to highlight this snippet. Prior to completing this challege I wasn't too familiar with the translate function. In this challenge I was ask to create a hover state for the image. This is only a snippet of how I worked through the process. In the end I learned about the translate function and the card is functional.
```scss
.middle {
  transition: .5s ease;
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

In furture projects I want to become more proficient in the utilization of sass stylesheets. As I feel that they give the most flexibility for customization. I also would like to grow in formating my code. I think that structure is huge and I'd prefer that my code would be easy to analyze interpret and implement. Lastly, I would like to try anout card challege and utilize the grid. In this challenge I wanted to force myself to not use the grid as a learning technique. However I think that the grid is beneficial if I am ever in a situation where I have to develop additional cards. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto/css/image/ovelay.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the translate function. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
