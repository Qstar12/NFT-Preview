### What I learned

Im proud to highlight this snippet. Prior to completing this challege I wasn't too familiar with the translate function. In this challenge I was ask to create a hover state for the image. This is only a snippet of how I worked through the process. In the end I learned about the translate function and the card is functional.
```scss
.middle {
  transition: .5s ease;
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}
```

### Continued development

In furture projects I want to become more proficient in the utilization of sass stylesheets. As I feel that they give the most flexibility for customization. I also would like to grow in formating my code. I think that structure is huge and I'd prefer that my code would be easy to analyze interpret and implement. Lastly, I would like to try anout card challege and utilize the grid. In this challenge I wanted to force myself to not use the grid as a learning technique. However I think that the grid is beneficial if I am ever in a situation where I have to develop additional cards. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto/css/image/ovelay.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the translate function. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
